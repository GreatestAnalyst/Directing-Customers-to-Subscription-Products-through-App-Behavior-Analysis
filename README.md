In today's market many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products, which originate from free ones, are ***YouTube Red, Pandora Premium, Audible Subscription, YouTube Premium***, and You Need a Budget. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.
- **Market:** The target audience is customers who use a company's free products. In this case study, this refers to users who installed (and used) the companies free mobile app.

- **Product:** The paid memberships often provide enhanced versions of the free products already given for free, alongside new features. For example, ***`Youtube Red allows you to leave the app while still listening to a video.`***

- **Goal:** The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to ***`convert`*** them to paid users.
